### Hi 👋

👋 I'm developing my skills to become an associate software engineer.

💻 I have been learning to code in my spare time for the past year and a lot of my achievements can be found in my repositories.

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 I am reconnecting with software engineering whilst looking after my young children.

😺 I'm currently learning React on Udemy. I am also completing Data and JavaScript KickStarters with CFG and Python based MOOC challenges.

🤝 I am looking for opportunities to collaborate with others to gain experience of working in a tech team.

👩‍🎓 I acheived a Maths and Computer Science Degree at Nottingham University in 2011 whilst competing as an international athlete.

💖 I am a trustee for Storrs Road Pre School which is a charity providing education for 2-5 year olds.
